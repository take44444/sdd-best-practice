# Create Feature Branch

Create and switch to a new git feature branch for the given specification. This command handles **branch creation only** — the spec directory and files are created by the core `/specify` workflow.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Prerequisites

- Verify Git is available by running `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null`
- If Git is not available, warn the user and skip branch creation

## Branch Numbering

The branch name strategy: sequential

## Execution

Generate a concise short name (2-4 words) for the branch:
- Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
- Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
- Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)

Run the appropriate script based on your platform:

- **Bash**: `scripts/create-new-feature.sh --json --short-name "<short-name>" "<feature description>"`

**IMPORTANT**:
- Do NOT pass `--number` — the script determines the correct next number automatically
- Always include the JSON flag (`--json` for Bash, `-Json` for PowerShell) so the output can be parsed reliably
- You must only ever run this script once per feature
- The JSON output will contain `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM`

## Graceful Degradation

If Git is not installed or the current directory is not a Git repository:
- Branch creation is skipped with a warning: `[git-hook] Warning: Git repository not detected; skipped branch creation`
- The script still outputs `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM` so the caller can reference them

## Output

The script outputs JSON with:
- `BRANCH_NAME`: The branch name (e.g., `003-user-auth`)
- `FEATURE_NUM`: The numeric or timestamp prefix used
